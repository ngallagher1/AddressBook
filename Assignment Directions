Write an application that implements and tests an address book class.
The address book will be implemented using an ArrayList of Contacts.
Your address book will contain several types of contacts:

Family Members
Personal Friends
Business Associates.

1. Create a class to represent a general contact. Decide on the
data fields and methods that you want to include in this class.

2. Create a class to represent a familiy member.  This class
should extend the contact class and contain data fields and 
methods appropriate for a member of your family.

3. Create a class to represent a personal friend.  This class
should extend the contact class and contain data fields and 
methods appropriate for a friend.

4. Create a class to represent a business associate.  This class
should extend the contact class and contain data fields and 
methods appropriate for a business associate.

5. Write an application that uses an ArrayList of contacts to hold
your address book.  Your application should add entries to the 
address book and test the methods in each of your classes.

Think carefully about the data elements and methods that you want 
to place in each class.  Be sure that each of your classes is 
well documented.
